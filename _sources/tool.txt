    sqlline> !connect jdbc:octopus://localhost
    scan complete in 16ms
    scan complete in 1031ms
    Enter username for jdbc:octopus://localhost: octopus
    Enter password for jdbc:octopus://localhost: *******
    Error: not implemented (state=,code=0)
    Error: not implemented (state=,code=0)
    Error: not implemented (state=,code=0)
    0: jdbc:octopus://localhost> !outputformat vertical
    0: jdbc:octopus://localhost> show all users;
    USER_NAME  octopus
    REMARKS    
    
    2 rows selected (0.008 seconds)
    0: jdbc:octopus://localhost> Closing: kr.co.bitnine.octopus.OctopusConnection
    
    $

The octaline uses sqlline(https://github.com/julianhyde/sqlline.git) in executing and running. If you want some detail, please refer the tool's documentation. And if you want somthing information about connection URL which is used to connection, please refer to 5.2.

octopus meta
------------
When you first install the Octopus because there is no user account information, you cannot connect to the Octopus even if you executed the Octopus. So for the purpose of convinience of the installation, the Octopus provide the command that can create the administrator's account. You can create an administrator's account before execute the Octopus instance by running an octopus script which is located in bin directory. For the example, if you want create an administrator account and set the password to that octopus and bitnine. 

.. code-block:: bash

    $ octopus meta
    Usage: octopus meta COMMAND ...
    where COMMAND is one of:
      -superuser    create a superuser with given <username> and <password>
    $ octopus meta â€“superuser octopus bitnine
    $

Administrator account refers to an account that has all the system privileges. For more information about system privileges, please refer to 4.4.2.
